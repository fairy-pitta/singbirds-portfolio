# Conservation Mapping Platform

## Project Overview

The Conservation Mapping Platform is a collaborative GIS-based tool designed to support conservation planning, protected area management, and biodiversity monitoring. It enables stakeholders to visualize, analyze, and share spatial data related to conservation priorities and interventions.

## Key Features

### Interactive Conservation Maps

The platform provides a suite of interactive mapping tools:

- Multi-layer visualization of conservation data
- Protected area boundary management
- Threat mapping and monitoring
- Biodiversity hotspot identification
- Corridor and connectivity analysis

### Collaborative Planning Tools

The platform facilitates collaborative conservation planning:

- Shared project workspaces
- Scenario modeling and comparison
- Annotation and discussion features
- Version control for conservation plans
- Stakeholder feedback integration

### Field Data Collection

The system supports field data collection and integration:

- Mobile data collection forms
- Offline capability for remote areas
- Photo and media attachment
- GPS tracking and route planning
- Data validation and quality control

## Technical Implementation

### Frontend

- React with TypeScript
- Leaflet.js for interactive maps
- Turf.js for geospatial analysis
- Material UI components
- Progressive Web App capabilities

### Backend

- Node.js with Express
- MongoDB for document storage
- PostgreSQL with PostGIS for spatial data
- AWS S3 for media storage
- Authentication with Auth0

### Data Integration

- Import/export in standard GIS formats
- API connections to biodiversity databases
- Integration with remote sensing platforms
- Automated reporting generation

## Impact and Results

The Conservation Mapping Platform has been used for:

- Management planning in 12 protected areas
- Collaborative conservation planning across 3 transboundary landscapes
- Monitoring of 5 endangered species recovery programs
- Training of 150+ conservation practitioners

Key outcomes include:

- 30% improvement in stakeholder engagement in planning processes
- More efficient allocation of conservation resources
- Better integration of scientific data into decision-making
- Enhanced monitoring of conservation outcomes

## Future Development

Planned enhancements include:

- Advanced spatial analysis tools
- Integration with environmental DNA sampling data
- Machine learning for habitat classification
- Enhanced community mapping features
- Climate change scenario modeling
