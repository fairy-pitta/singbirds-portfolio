# Bird Migration Tracker

## Project Overview

The Bird Migration Tracker is an interactive web application designed to visualize and analyze bird migration patterns across Southeast Asia. This tool helps researchers, conservationists, and bird enthusiasts understand migration routes, timing, and how these patterns are affected by environmental changes.

## Key Features

### Interactive Migration Maps

The core of the application is a set of interactive maps built with Leaflet.js and D3.js that display:

- Real-time and historical migration routes
- Population density heatmaps
- Stopover locations and duration analysis
- Environmental data overlays (weather patterns, habitat changes)

### Data Analysis Dashboard

The dashboard provides tools for analyzing migration data:

- Temporal analysis of migration timing
- Species comparison tools
- Year-over-year trend analysis
- Climate correlation studies

### Citizen Science Integration

The platform incorporates data from citizen scientists:

- Bird sighting submissions
- Validation and verification systems
- Contributor recognition and gamification
- Educational resources on migration

## Technical Implementation

### Frontend

- React for the user interface
- D3.js and Leaflet.js for data visualization
- Tailwind CSS for styling
- Framer Motion for animations

### Backend

- Node.js with Express
- MongoDB for data storage
- Python for data processing and analysis
- AWS S3 for image storage

### Data Sources

- GPS tracking data from research partners
- eBird API integration
- Weather and climate data APIs
- Satellite imagery for habitat analysis

## Impact and Results

The Bird Migration Tracker has been used by:

- 12 research institutions across Southeast Asia
- Over 500 citizen scientists contributing data
- Conservation planning initiatives in 4 countries
- Educational programs reaching 1,000+ students

The platform has helped identify:

- 3 previously unknown migration routes
- 5 critical stopover locations in need of conservation
- Significant shifts in migration timing due to climate change

## Future Development

Planned enhancements include:

- Machine learning for migration prediction
- Mobile app development
- Expanded coverage to include more species
- Integration with other regional tracking systems

## Acknowledgements

This project was developed in collaboration with the Southeast Asian Bird Conservation Network and funded by a grant from the International Conservation Technology Initiative.
