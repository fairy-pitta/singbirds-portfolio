## Overview

I recently built my personal portfolio website over two days, focusing on keeping the process straightforward and efficient. Rather than overcomplicating the project, I aimed to create a clear, maintainable site that represents my work accurately.

## Tech Stack and Workflow

* **Frontend Hosting:** [Cloudflare Pages](https://pages.cloudflare.com/)
* **Domain Management:** [Cloudflare DNS](https://www.cloudflare.com/dns/)
* **Email (Contact Form & Newsletter):** [Resend](https://resend.com/) + [Cloudflare Workers](https://workers.cloudflare.com/)
* **UI Design & Component Styling:** [v0.dev](https://v0.dev/) + [Shadcn UI](https://ui.shadcn.dev/)
* **CSS Framework:** [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/)
* **Framework:** [Next.js (App Router)](https://nextjs.org/)

### Key Features

* Fully responsive design
* Blog and Projects that are easily editable
* Markdown files converted to HTML for blog and project content to avoid repetitive HTML/CSS work
* Animated bird flying across the top page
* Smooth parallax backgrounds and scroll effects
* Contact form and newsletter signup integrated with Resend and Cloudflare Workers
* Clean and simple UI, composed with v0.dev and Shadcn components
* Custom domain set up through Cloudflare DNS

## Development Breakdown

* **Day 1:**

  * Defined the UI layout and page structure
  * Adjusted and finalized the UI using v0.dev and Shadcn components
  * Set up TailwindCSS and basic styling

* **Day 2:**

  * Deployed the frontend to Cloudflare Pages
  * Linked the contact form and newsletter features to Resend and Cloudflare Workers
  * Configured a custom domain using Cloudflare DNS
  * Finalized minor styling adjustments and tested responsiveness

The two-day development timeline was manageable because of a straightforward workflow and familiarity with the tools used. Even with some additional refinements, the project could easily be completed within three days.

## Reflections

This project demonstrates my ability to:

* Build a complete and maintainable site within a short time frame
* Focus on clarity and simplicity in both design and development
* Integrate external services like Resend and Cloudflare Workers smoothly
* Handle domain setup, project deployment, and site operation independently
