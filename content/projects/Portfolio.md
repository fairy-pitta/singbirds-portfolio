## Overview

I recently built my personal portfolio website over two days, focusing on keeping the process straightforward and efficient. Rather than overcomplicating the project, I aimed to create a clear, maintainable site that represents my work accurately.

## Tech Stack and Workflow

- **Frontend Hosting:** [AWS Amplify](https://aws.amazon.com/amplify/)
- **Domain Management:** [AWS Route 53](https://aws.amazon.com/route53/)
- **Email (Contact Form & Newsletter):** [Resend](https://resend.com/)
- **UI Design & Component Styling:** [v0.dev](https://v0.dev/) + [Shadcn UI](https://ui.shadcn.dev/)
- **CSS Framework:** [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/)
- **Framework:** [Next.js (App Router)](https://nextjs.org/)

### Key Features

- Fully responsive design
- Blog and Projects that are easily editable
- Markdown files converted to HTML for blog and project content to avoid repetitive HTML/CSS work
- Animated bird flying across the top page
- Smooth parallax backgrounds and scroll effects
- Contact form and newsletter signup integrated with Resend
- Clean and simple UI, composed with v0.dev and Shadcn components
- Custom domain set up through AWS Route 53

## Development Breakdown

- **Day 1:**
  - Defined the UI layout and page structure
  - Adjusted and finalized the UI using v0.dev and Shadcn components
  - Set up TailwindCSS and basic styling

- **Day 2:**
  - Deployed the frontend to AWS Amplify
  - Linked the contact form and newsletter features to Resend
  - Configured a custom domain using AWS Route 53
  - Finalized minor styling adjustments and tested responsiveness

The two-day development timeline was manageable because of a straightforward workflow and familiarity with the tools used. Even with some additional refinements, the project could easily be completed within three days.

## Reflections

This project demonstrates my ability to:

- Build a complete and maintainable site within a short time frame
- Focus on clarity and simplicity in both design and development
- Integrate external services like Resend smoothly
- Handle domain setup, project deployment, and site operation independently
