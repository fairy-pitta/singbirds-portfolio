- Compress and optimize images
- Use efficient caching strategies
- Implement lazy loading for non-critical resources

### 2. Choose Green Hosting

- Select hosting providers powered by renewable energy
- Consider serverless architectures for appropriate use cases
- Optimize server configurations for energy efficiency

### 3. Design for Efficiency

- Implement dark mode to reduce screen energy consumption
- Create lightweight, minimalist designs
- Use system fonts instead of custom font files when possible
- Optimize CSS and JavaScript

## Measuring Your Impact

Several tools can help you measure and improve your website's environmental impact:

- Website Carbon Calculator

## Conclusion

By implementing sustainable web development practices, developers can significantly reduce the environmental impact of their digital products while often improving performance and user experience at the same time.
